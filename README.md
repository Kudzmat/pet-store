# pet-store
Simple introduction web app which uses Python’s Flask framework to create a simple pet adoption site that contains multiple routes.
Imagine you are looking to add a new furry friend to your family! On the pet adoption website, you browse through the categories of animals and 
select the one you’re interested in, which brings you to another page that contains a list of available pets. Then, you continue your search by 
further clicking on an individual pet to view its profile page.
